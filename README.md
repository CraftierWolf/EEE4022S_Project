# EEE4022S_Project
For the code necessary path changes need to be made depending where the file or folder are stored. Folders for data storage will likely need to be created. 


The following code has been uploaded into specific branches. 
1. The Matlab code used to process RSSI data and write it to an excel spread sheet
-kFMCapture.m, fiveFMCapture.m and DABCapture.m are the main scripts to run to process and write the RSSI data
2. The Matlab code used for the data analysis.
- The data_analysis.m is the script to run the chosen method which obtains graphs of your choice
3. The R code for the principal component analysis
-The PCA.Rproj along withPCA2.R can be run to see the implementation of the PCA code. The xlsx files with correctly formatted data is in this folder
4. The visual basic scripts for the implementation of the macros in the macro-enabled Exce spreadsheets
-The visual basic scripts and the text files used are in this folder
5. The Excel spreadsheets
-The 89MHz, 94.5MHz and DAB signal macro-enabled excel sheets are available here
6. The batch and text files used to implement IQ data capture
-The batch and text files are uploaded.
